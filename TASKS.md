## Notes Section

### Task Dependencies
- Backend must be functional before frontend integration
- Visual testing requires live application
- Agent validation happens after feature completion
- Production deployment requires all testing complete

### Risk Mitigation
- Keep tasks small and testable
- Regular agent validation prevents rework
- Mobile testing throughout development, not just at end
- Security considerations built into each milestone

### Success Metrics
- Each milestone should be demo-ready
- No milestone marked complete without agent approval
- All tasks must pass quality gates before proceeding
- Phase 1 complete only when all success criteria met
